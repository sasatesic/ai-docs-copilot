# Qdrant Vector Store

Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine and vector database. It can store and search vectors with high performance. In this project, Qdrant is used to store document chunks and their associated metadata, such as the source_id (filename) and chunk_index. This allows for efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
